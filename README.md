### Description

Code Fixer Help File 3.0.4

This is the Help File for Code Fixer 3. It is presented as a separate upload so you don't have to download it every time there is a bug fix to the program. Help file is only updated if a new tool or fix is added to the program. For bug fix details see the history.txt file in the program zip file.

WARNING Code Fixer is very powerful, 'Suck it and see' is not a good idea with this add-in. Don't operate it without checking the help file.
